Important Security Alert for TERMUX-TERMINAL-COMMUNICATION-TOOL Users

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

We have recently conducted a thorough security analysis of the TERMUX-TERMINAL-COMMUNICATION-TOOL and discovered a significant threat. It has come to our attention that a harmful virus is activated when both devices are connected to the same network.

{What We Discovered}:
During our investigation, we found that once two devices establish a connection through the Termux terminal on the same network, the server becomes vulnerable. This vulnerability allows the virus to exploit the connection, potentially compromising both devices. The virus can spread rapidly, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.

{Key Findings}:
Network Vulnerability: The virus is triggered specifically when devices communicate over the same network.

{Malicious Activity}: Once connected, the server can become a target for harmful elements, increasing the risk of data theft and system corruption.

{Beta Version Risks}:
As this tool is currently in beta, it lacks the robust security measures that will be implemented in future updates.

{Immediate Actions Required}:
Disconnect from the Network: If you are currently using the tool, please disconnect your devices from the network immediately.

{Avoid Using the Tool}: 
We strongly advise against using the TERMUX-TERMINAL-COMMUNICATION-TOOL until a new, secure version is released.

{Monitor Your Devices}:
Keep an eye on your devices for any unusual behavior or unauthorized access.

{Upcoming Security Measures}:
We are actively working on a new update that will address these vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security of the tool.
 
{This update will include}:

(Improved Network Security Protocols): To safeguard against unauthorized access.

(Advanced Threat Detection Systems): To identify and neutralize potential threats in real-time.

(User Notifications): Alerts for any suspicious activity detected during use.

{Conclusion}:
Your safety is our utmost priority. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to resolve these issues. Please stay tuned for updates regarding the release of the new version.
