# Read Carefully before installing.

*Getting Started with Our Chat Tool (BETA)*

To use our chat tool, follow these simple steps:

1. *Ensure device proximity*: Have two devices nearby, preferably with one being your friend's device.
2. *Establish a network connection*: Turn on the hotspot on one device and connect to the same network using Wi-Fi on the other device. Both devices must be connected to the same network for the tool to function.
3. *Install the scripts*: On Device 1, install the `(link unavailable)` script, and on Device 2, install the `(link unavailable)` script.
4. *Start chatting*: Once installed, you can chat with each other using the Termux terminal.
*Important Notes*:
- This is a BETA version, and you may encounter issues. Please report any problems to us, and we'll work to resolve them as soon as possible.
- Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve the tool.
- Future updates, including version 1.4, will focus on adding security features and enhancing overall functionality. We also plan to develop an anonymous SMS sender feature in the future.

(_Reliable and Tested Tool_)

We're proud to offer a 100% functional tool that delivers on its promises. Unlike fake or untested tools, our script has been thoroughly tested on our own devices before being released on GitHub.
